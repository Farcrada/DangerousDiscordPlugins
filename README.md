# DangerousDiscordPlugins
A repository for plugins that can get a user banned (selfbotting). This describes actions that rely on API calls. API means that the servers of Discord are contacted to execute an action; such as moving a user from voice channel to voice channel.

## Let me reiterate: Regardless of how one uses these plugins they have a certain guarantee to get your Discord account banned.
Responsibility is solely in the user that installs these.
