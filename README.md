# DangerousDiscordPlugins
A repository for plugins that can get a user banned (selfbotting).

## Let me reiterate: Regardless of how one uses these plugins they have a certain guarantee to get your Discord account banned.
Responsibility is solely in the user that installs these. 

# Requirements
These plugins require you to have Better Discord installed: https://betterdiscord.app/ (Simply press the big ol' download button).

# Installation
Download the `.plugin.js` file and put it inside your plugins folder

## OldColours.css
This file is to revert to the old colours Discord replaced in the new update. Instead of installing some random theme that is basically just CSS and a link to some website, this bit of CSS you can simply paste in the `Custom CSS` page on your BD settings. Make sure to restart Discord after saving.

## Plugins folder
- Press the cogwheel (bottom left) next to the microphone and headphone-icon;
- Go to `Plugins` at the bottom right;
- Click `Open Plugin Folder` at the top (file explorer can appear behind Discord itself, so check your taskbar);
- Put the `.plugin.js` file there.
